**Lektos** is a **cross-platform** project in development, focused on creating a flexible and practical reading and learning environment for language learners. The goal is to make it easier to read texts, look up words quickly, manage vocabulary efficiently, and build spaced repetition notes ‚Äî **all in the same place.**

The project is inspired by platforms like **LingQ** and the open-source project **LUTE**, which introduced powerful ideas for text-driven learning. Lektos builds on these inspirations but follows its own path, focusing on smoother word management, better mobile reading integration, and freedom to extract and work with texts like EPUB and PDF. We also plan to explore features like audio generation to support pronunciation practice.

Lektos is being designed for mobile, tablets, and desktop, with mobile as a priority since that‚Äôs where most people actually read. It will be free and open to the community, with optional internet-based features like online dictionaries and image searches to complement the core experience.

## ‚ú® Project Goals
- **Seamless reading and learning:** one tap to look up a word, one tap to add it to spaced repetition.
- **Local-first design:** reading, dictionary, and spaced repetition happen directly on the device.
- **Cross-platform support:** Android, Windows, Linux, macOS, and tablet-friendly from the start.
- **Efficient word management:** easy tracking, tagging, and reviewing of known/unknown words.
- **Open and community-driven:** built to welcome contributions and future plugins.

## üöß Current Development Stage
The project is in its early foundation phase. We are carefully building the core structure so the community can join easily and help shape the tool.

Some key decisions are intentionally open and will be made as the project evolves.

## ü§ù Contribution Guide

The contribution guidelines for Lektos are still in development.  
For now:
- Feel free to open a discussion or comment on open questions.
- Early feedback, ideas, and suggestions are welcome.

Once the core structure is stable, we will:
- Define contribution workflows
- Set up coding standards and best practices
- Label beginner-friendly issues

The project will always be open to contributors interested in code, design, or community building.
